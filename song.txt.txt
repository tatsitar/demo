welcom to my world
Step right through the door
Leave your tranquilizers at home
You don’t need them anymore

All the drama queens have gone
And the devil got dismayed
He packed up and fled this town
His master plan delayed
================================

And if you stay a while
I’ll penetrate your soul
I’ll bleed into your dreams
You'll want to lose control
